I am an incoming MSc Blockchain & Financial Technologies graduate from the University of East London, where I am expected to graduate with a First-Class degree. I am looking for graduate roles as a Software Developer, Frontend Developer, Blockchain Developer, and Project Analyst. 

My interest in technology started during my undergraduate studies and grew as I researched how Blockchain and Federated learning can solve real-world problems. Working with experts, I designed solutions to protect data while ensuring seamless storing, sharing and explored how blockchain supports sustainability. These experiences showed me how technical skills and creativity can address complex challenges in real-world, and Iâ€™m now excited to apply this passion in graduate roles to build impactful solutions.
